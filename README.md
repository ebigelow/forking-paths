### Code for *Forking Paths in Neural Text Generation*

https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07961


More documentation will be added here soon.


Repo for [streamlit dashboard](https://forking-paths.streamlit.app): [ebigelow/forking-paths-streamlit](https://github.com/ebigelow/forking-paths-streamlit)   There, you can find all data used for analysis in this paper. That data is in a post-processed dataframe format, I will try to find a way to also host the raw completions data, which is fairly large in size.
